A collection of helpful linux AMD GPU mining utilities. Mostly focused on XMR, AMD RX570 and Vega Frontier Edition, plus the Vega 56.

The init scripts are for Ubuntu 16.0.4
The fan scripts assume a working lm-sensors package, 255 is max RPM.
The profitability script uses http://whattomine.com/coins.json and you can add to the watchlist for currencies that matter to you vs. the 24hour/immediate stats.

Both of the stats scripts for XMR and Claymore need to be modified to reflect hosts in your network. XMR has to be built with microhttpd (apt install libmicrohttpd-dev for ubuntu)

The vega-xmr.init file is a bit unique in that it launches two processes - one for my RX5XX cards and one for my Vega cards. The Vega cards use ROCM and need to run as a normal user, hence:

    #
    # NOTE::: The new Vega and Frontiers use ROCM. At least with Ubuntu, I have to launch xmr-stak as myself, NOT as root as I normally would.
    # Certain performance capabilitie are not available with OpenCL and legacy devices (rx5xx), if not running as root. Therefore there are two
    # init statements if you run a mixed system as I do. Modify to suite otherwise
    #

Happy mining!
